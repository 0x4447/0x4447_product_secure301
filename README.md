# Secure301

The secure301 stack is a simple solution to an annoying problem - it allows you to have HTTPS redirects with a 301 message. To achieve this the stack utilizes the API Gateway. 

When deploying the stack you have to only manually make a SSL Certificate using the AWS Certificate Manager service, provide all the details in the deployment phase, and you'll get a working redirect. 

We chose to use API Gateway for this because using CloudFront in conjunction with S3 is very slow to work with. It take CloudFront 20 min to deploy the resources across all the regions, where as API Gateway is also deliver over CloudFront, but the deployment is instant. Since CloudFront in this case is managed by AWS itself.

The stack was designed to handle one redirectsion per deployment to keep the solution simple and straight forward.

# What will deploy?

- 1x API Gateway
- 1x API Gateway Domain

# Manual work

- Once deployed you have to take the geenral API  Gateway domian and update your DNS record.

# How to generate the CloudFormation file

This repo was build using the [Grapes Frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x4447/grapes). First you need to install the framework:

```
sudo npm install -g @0x4447/grapes
```

Then, go inside this repo and run this command:

```
grapes -s .
```

This will create a `CloudFormation.json` file in the root dir of the repo which you can upload to AWS.
